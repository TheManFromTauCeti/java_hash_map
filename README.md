Hash Map for Java
=================

These files represent one way to implement a [Hash Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) in Java.
Feel free to look at them if you need some ideas for how you might implement your own Hash Map :)


Quick point about these files
-----------------------------
These files are a actually only part of a larger repo I created for an assignment in a course on Data Structures 
in the [BIT program](https://catalogue.rrc.ca/Programs/WPG/Fulltime/BUSGF-DP) at [Red River College](https://www.rrc.ca/). 
That repo contained files I cannot store here. The files I can post I've posted here for anyone who needs inspiration for implementing a Hash Map.
